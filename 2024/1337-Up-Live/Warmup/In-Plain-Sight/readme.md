## In Plain Sight
Barely hidden tbh..
## Approach
We find that we are given a jpg image file called meow.jpg
Running it through `binwalk`, there is a compressed zip archive with a password in it.

We have an encrypted Zip file but no password now

Running the `meow.jpg` through strings we find something interesting

Trying `YoullNeverGetThis719482`  as the password we are able to sucessfully decrypt it. 
We get a file called `flag.png` which is completely blank

Uploading the `flag.png` to `https://aperisolve.com` we are able to view the [flag](https://www.aperisolve.com/ed9edd995a595a8a6e359ec6719ede98)
